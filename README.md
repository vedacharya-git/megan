# MEGAN - Machine Enabled General Assistance Node
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20progress-yellow)

This project, MEGAN v0.5, is a work in progress. I've achieved Phase 1.

## Overview
MEGAN (Machine Enabled General Assistance Node) is a modular, local-first voice assistant powered by Python and LangGraph. It's built to run fully offline using local LLMs (via Ollama), starting with a command-line interface before evolving into a full voice-enabled system.

Currently, this is a minimal implementation of LangGraph running on the terminal. Phase 1 is complete!

## Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- Ollama with Mistral-nemo
    - Install Ollama from: https://ollama.com/download
    - Install Mistral-nemo from
    ```bash
    ollama pull mistral-nemo
    ```
    or follow instructions on their [website](https://ollama.com/library/mistral-nemo)
        - Chosen 'mistral-nemo' because it's recommended for tool-calling on [Ollama's blog](https://ollama.com/blog/tool-support).

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vedacharya-git/megan.git
```

2. Navigate to folder:
```bash
cd megan
```

3. Setup virtual environment *or don't*

Create a Python environment using Conda or `venv`, the virtual environment handler of your choice.

Or donâ€™t listen to meâ€”you could just run it in your base environment and play into the hands of the devil. I'm not your dad. ðŸ™‚

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
By default, logs are not printed to the command line.
To enable logging: open `main.py` and set
`LoggerManager.PRINT_LOG = False` â†’ `True`

## Execution Plan:
- [x] Phase 1: Basic command-line interface
- [ ] Phase 2: Voice input/output loop
- [ ] Phase 3: Tool integration
- [ ] Phase 4: LangGraph orchestration
- [ ] Phase 5: Finalise system and polish

## Disclaimer
Tested on Ubuntu 22.04. Not yet tested on Windows or macOS, but theoretically it should work.
If it doesn'tâ€”pull requests are appreciated.
